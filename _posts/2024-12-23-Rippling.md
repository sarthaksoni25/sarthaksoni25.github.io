title: "My Rippling Interview – Designing a Song Analytics System"

During my first-round interview with **Rippling**, I was asked to design a system for analyzing song play analytics. It was an engaging problem that involved system design, data modeling, and edge-case handling. I made good progress but stumbled a bit on a tricky tie-breaking case—when two songs had the same number of unique listeners. Debugging that took more time than I expected, and I didn’t make it to the next round.

*Note: This post is a generalized version of the problem, written from memory for educational purposes.*

### The Problem Statement

The task was to build a `SongAnalytics` class capable of:

1. **Adding songs**: Assign a unique ID to each song and store its name.
2. **Tracking song plays**: Record plays of a song by unique users.
3. **Generating analytics**: Print a summary of songs sorted by the number of unique listeners.

### Breaking Down the Solution

Here’s how I approached the problem in C++ using standard data structures like `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`, and `map`.

#### Data Structures:

- `unordered_map<int, string>`: Maps a song ID to its name.
- `unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>`: Tracks which users played each song.
- `map<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>`: Sorts songs by their unique listener count.

#### Class Implementation

The `SongAnalytics` class includes three main methods:

1. **`add_song`**: Adds a new song to the system with a unique ID.
2. **`play_song`**: Records a song play for a given user.
3. **`print_analytics`**: Sorts and prints songs by unique listeners.

#### Code Implementation

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class SongAnalytics {
private:
    int nextSongId = 1;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::string> songIdToName;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::unordered_set<int>> songPlays;

public:
    int add_song(const std::string &songName) {
        int songId = nextSongId++;
        songIdToName[songId] = songName;
        return songId;
    }

    void play_song(int songId, int userId) {
        if (songIdToName.find(songId) == songIdToName.end()) {
            std::cerr << "Error: Song ID " << songId << " does not exist.\n";
            return;
        }
        songPlays[songId].insert(userId);
    }

    void print_analytics() {
        std::map<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> sortedAnalytics;

        for (const auto &entry : songPlays) {
            int songId = entry.first;
            int uniqueListeners = entry.second.size();
            sortedAnalytics[uniqueListeners].push_back(songId);
        }

        for (const auto &entry : sortedAnalytics) {
            int uniqueListeners = entry.first;
            for (int songId : entry.second) {
                std::cout << songIdToName[songId] << " (" << uniqueListeners << " unique listeners)\n";
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    SongAnalytics analytics;

    int song1 = analytics.add_song("Song A");
    int song2 = analytics.add_song("Song B");
    int song3 = analytics.add_song("Song C");

    analytics.play_song(song1, 1);
    analytics.play_song(song1, 2);
    analytics.play_song(song2, 1);
    analytics.play_song(song3, 3);
    analytics.play_song(song3, 3); // duplicate play, shouldn't count twice

    analytics.print_analytics();

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Reflection

This interview was a solid reminder that small details, especially around edge cases, can have a big impact. While I got most of the system working correctly, I spent too long debugging the tie-breaking logic. That cost me valuable time.

Still, I enjoyed the problem and appreciated Rippling's thoughtful design challenge. On to the next!
