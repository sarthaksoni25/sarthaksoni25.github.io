During my first-round interview with Rippling, I faced a challenge to design a system for analyzing song play analytics. I made good progress but got stuck on a tricky edge case—how to handle ties when two songs had the same number of unique listens. It took me some time to debug and find the root cause. I was able to fix it, but it took quite a while, ultimately leading to a rejection.

### The Problem Statement

The task was to create a `SongAnalytics` class capable of:

1. **Adding songs**: Assign a unique ID to each song and store its name.
2. **Tracking song plays**: Record plays of a song by unique users.
3. **Generating analytics**: Print a summary of songs sorted by the number of unique listeners.

### Breaking Down the Solution

Here’s how the problem can be solved in C++ using a combination of `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`, and `map`.

#### Data Structures:

- `unordered_map<int, string>`: Maps a song ID to its name.
- `unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>`: Tracks which users played a specific song using a set of user IDs for each song.
- `map<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>`: Used to sort songs by the count of unique listeners.

#### Class Implementation

The `SongAnalytics` class includes three key methods:

1. **`add_song`**: Adds a song to the system and assigns a unique ID.
2. **`play_song`**: Records a user’s play for a specific song. If the song ID doesn’t exist, an error is displayed.
3. **`print_analytics`**: Aggregates and sorts the songs by unique listener count, then prints the results.

#### Code Implementation

Below is the implementation of the `SongAnalytics` class in C++:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class SongAnalytics {
private:
    int nextSongId = 1;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::string> songIdToName;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::unordered_set<int>> songPlays;

public:
    // Add a song to the system and assign a unique ID
    int add_song(const std::string &songName) {
        int songId = nextSongId++;
        songIdToName[songId] = songName;
        return songId;
    }

    // Record a user's play for a specific song
    void play_song(int songId, int userId) {
        if (songIdToName.find(songId) == songIdToName.end()) {
            std::cerr << "Error: Song ID " << songId << " does not exist.\n";
            return;
        }
        songPlays[songId].insert(userId);
    }

    // Print songs sorted by the number of unique listeners
    void print_analytics() {
        std::map<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> sortedAnalytics;

        for (const auto &entry : songPlays) {
            int songId = entry.first;
            int uniqueListeners = entry.second.size();
            sortedAnalytics[uniqueListeners].push_back(songId);
        }

        for (const auto &entry : sortedAnalytics) {
            int uniqueListeners = entry.first;
            for (int songId : entry.second) {
                std::cout << songIdToName[songId] << " (" << uniqueListeners << " unique listeners)\n";
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    SongAnalytics analytics;

    int song1 = analytics.add_song("Song A");
    int song2 = analytics.add_song("Song B");
    int song3 = analytics.add_song("Song C");

    analytics.play_song(song1, 1);
    analytics.play_song(song1, 2);
    analytics.play_song(song2, 1);
    analytics.play_song(song3, 3);
    analytics.play_song(song3, 3);

    analytics.print_analytics();

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Reflection

The given problem was a medium-hard problem that tested both my problem-solving and coding skills. I’m glad I managed to code up the entire solution correctly, but unfortunately, I received a rejection because debugging the tie-breaking issue took more time than expected. It was a good experience, but hard luck this time. Better luck next time!
