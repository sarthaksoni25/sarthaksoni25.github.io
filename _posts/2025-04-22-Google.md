I recently interviewed with **Google** for a senior software engineer role. The entire process was focused on **DSA** (data structures and algorithms). There were no system design rounds.

Here's a breakdown of each round, along with some reflections.

## 📞 Telephonic Interview – November End

I was given an interesting **in-place string compression** problem.

The input was a simple ASCII string with repeated characters, and the task was to compress it in-place. The catch? I wasn’t allowed to use any extra data structures. No arrays, no maps, not even a second pass.

I had to rely on a couple of pointers and some clever logic to count character repetitions and build a compressed version like `"a2b1c3"` directly in the input buffer. It was a good test of string manipulation and low-level control.

✅ **Result**: Lean hire

## 🧮 Round 1 – February End

This was a multi-part round focused on **text layout and wrapping logic**. All three problems were about line breaking and formatting.

### Part 1: Free-form Wrapping

- **Input**: A string `text` and an integer `width`
- **Task**: Calculate how many lines are needed if we can break the text at any character.

### Part 2: Word-wrap Constraint

- **Input**: Same string `text` and integer `width`
- **Task**: Count the number of lines needed if words cannot be split. If a word doesn’t fit at the end of a line, move it to the next one.

### Part 3: Two-column Layout

- **Input**: Two strings `text1`, `text2` and an integer `totalWidth`
- **Scenario**: You have a two-column layout and need to assign widths to each column so that they add up to `totalWidth`
- **Goal**: Choose `width1` and `width2` so that the taller of the two columns (based on line count) is as short as possible

This round really tested clarity in thinking and clean code structure.

✅ **Result**: Lean hire

## 🧠 Round 2 – Data Structures Deep Dive

### Problem: Range Sum Query 2D - Mutable (Similar to [Leetcode 308](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-mutable/))

I was asked to implement a `NumMatrix` class with two key operations:

- `update(row, col, val)`: Update a cell in the matrix
- `sumRegion(row1, col1, row2, col2)`: Return the sum of a rectangular region in the matrix

This tested my understanding of 2D prefix sums and techniques like segment trees or Binary Indexed Trees for updates.

✅ **Result**: Strong hire

## 🌟 Round 3 – Googliness and Collaboration

This round focused on behavioral questions and collaboration. We talked about how I work in teams, handle ambiguity, and resolve conflicts. It was conversational, but also deep. A lot of it was about how I make decisions, communicate, and learn from past experiences.

✅ **Result**: Hire

## 🔺 Round 4 – Geometry and Edge Case Handling

### Problem: Maximum Area Rectangle from Points

- **Input**: A list of 2D coordinate points
- **Task**: Find the largest area of any rectangle that can be formed using four of those points

The tricky part was that the rectangles didn’t have to be aligned to the axes. So it involved checking all possible point combinations, figuring out whether they form right angles, and making sure we weren’t misidentifying shapes.

❌ **Result**: No hire

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

The Google interview process was intense, but also well-organized and interesting. Each round pushed me in a different way, from low-level implementation and layout problems, to data structures, geometry, and even communication style.

After the interviews, I was moved to **team matching**. Unfortunately, none of the teams picked my profile. That means I’m in a **1-year cooldown** before I can apply again.

Still, I gained a lot from the process: better prep habits, stronger problem-solving skills, and more confidence overall. Time to take that momentum forward and keep applying.
