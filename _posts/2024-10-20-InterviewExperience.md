I recently went through a technical interview at Autodesk, and I wanted to share some of the questions I was asked. The round covered a mix of topics from real-world tech challenges to deeper dives into APIs and algorithms. Here’s a breakdown of what came up:

1. **Talking About a Recent Tech Challenge:**
   - They started by asking me to describe a recent technical challenge I faced. It was an open-ended question where I had to walk them through a problem I encountered, how I tackled it, and what the outcome was.

2. **Cache Concepts:**
   - We moved on to caching, where I had to explain what I knew about different types of caches and where they’re useful.

3. **Disadvantages of LRU Cache:**
   - Next, we talked specifically about the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache, focusing on its downsides. For example, how it may not always be the most optimal for certain workloads that don’t benefit from just removing the least recently accessed item.

4. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):**
   - One problem was to sort an array like this:
     ```cpp
     arr[] = {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1}
     ```
     The goal was to transform it into:
     ```cpp
     arr[] = {0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
     ```
     I solved it using a two-pointer approach.

   - **Follow-up:** They added a twist by asking how I’d handle arrays with multiple values, like `[-1, 0, 1]` or something more complex like `[0, -1, -1, 1, 1, 0, -1, 1]`.

5. **SQL Query Optimization:**
   - We also discussed SQL query optimization. I had to talk about ways to make a query more efficient—things like indexing, reducing the number of joins, and writing queries to minimize the load on the database.

6. **Profiling SQL Queries:**
   - I was asked if I have profiled any sql queries.

7. **OAuth 2.0:**
   - This was a deep dive into how OAuth 2.0 works. I had to explain how the authorization flow works and what’s involved in implementing it securely, including tokens, authorization servers, and client authentication.

8. **Designing Twitter-like API Endpoints:**
   - They gave me a design challenge where I had to create REST API endpoints for a Twitter-like service:
     - **GetATweet:** Fetch a specific tweet.
     - **GetAllTweets:** Retrieve all tweets.
     - **UpdateATweet:** Update the contents of an existing tweet.

It was a well-rounded interview that tested problem-solving, design thinking, and optimization skills.
