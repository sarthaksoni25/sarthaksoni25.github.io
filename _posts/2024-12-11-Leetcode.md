Investing in LeetCode Premium: Black Friday Purchase

This Black Friday, I finally decided to go for it and buy LeetCode Premium! I’ve been using the free version for a while, and while it’s been helpful, I always wondered if the premium features would give me an extra edge. The Black Friday deal—$30 off the usual $159 yearly price—made it an easier decision.

My current progress: <br>

LeetCode Premium gives you access to tons of coding problems sorted by difficulty, topic, and even company-specific questions. What really sold me is the collection of problems reportedly asked in actual interviews at top companies. 

As someone gearing up for technical interviews, I’m hoping Premium will:
<ul>
<li>
Help me zero in on problems from companies I’m targeting.
</li>
<li>
Expose me to more challenging questions to push my problem-solving skills.
</li>
<li>
Give me the confidence to nail those technical rounds.
</li>
</ul>
I’ll be spending more focused time on LeetCode over the next few weeks, and I’ll come back to update this post with whether it actually helps me. Fingers crossed it’ll be worth the investment!

If you’ve used LeetCode Premium, let me know your thoughts. I’d love to hear about your experience!


<!-- ## MathJax

You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$


## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.
