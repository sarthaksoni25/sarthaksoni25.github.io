Following up from my last post, Iâ€™ve added a basic authentication screen to AddVenture. No database yet; it's all temporary for now.

I also integrated Ant Design to clean up the UI a bit.

Hereâ€™s how it looks currently:

I set up CI/CD pipelines using YAML workflows in GitHub. The frontend is built with `npm run build` and deployed to an S3 bucket.

ðŸ’¡ One hiccup I ran into: `.env.production` was in `.gitignore`, so GitHub Actions didnâ€™t pick up the API URL. Had to fix that by committing the file.

For the backend (hosted on EC2), Iâ€™m using SSH via a `.pem` file. GitHub Actions uses this private key to connect, pull the latest code, and restart the server with `pm2`.

Still rough around the edges, but the pipeline is live and working. Pretty cool to see it deploy cleanly with every push to `main`.

Next things to work on is:
1) HTTPS since it's still insecure with http
2) Global Leaderboard
3) Proper authentication

Stay tuned
