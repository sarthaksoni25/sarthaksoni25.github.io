title: "Hosting new website on AWS"

In my work at MathWorks, I don't use AWS to host websites. We have on-prem machines which we use to host servers. I wanted to try out and host a simple maths website using AWS.

I wanted to follow the industry standards. I created a new simple math game. This game gives 10 problems to solve. I set up a simple Node Express server for the backend and a React frontend.

For setting up AWS, I used a free tier account. I remember I had an AWS account which had some outstanding bill during college time. Thankfully, I did not use that email and set up a new account. I hope no Amazon execs are reading this blog.

I used an EC2 instance to start the server and an S3 bucket for the frontend.


This is how it looks right now:

if you find the link broken ping me. I will most likely move to a domain name eventually.

I am planning to work on the following things:

1. **User History** â€“ Store the player's history in the backend using the EC2 server  
2. **Set up a DevOps pipeline** â€“ i.e., pushing to Git will deploy to prod  
3. **Improve the frontend** â€“ and increase difficulty
4. **Add HTTPS support** â€“ secure the site using SSL via CloudFront or Certbot
