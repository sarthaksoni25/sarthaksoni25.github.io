Investing in LeetCode Premium: Black Friday Purchase

This Black Friday, I finally decided to take the plunge and invest in LeetCode Premium! After seeing countless recommendations and success stories, I figured the discounted price was the perfect opportunity to see if it lives up to the hype.

LeetCode Premium offers access to a huge variety of coding problems categorized by difficulty, topic, and company-specific questions. What intrigued me most is its repository of problems asked by top tech companies during interviews. The discussion forums and solutions written by other users add an extra layer of learning, providing multiple approaches to the same problem.

As someone preparing for technical interviews, I hope the premium subscription will:

Help me focus my preparation by targeting problems from specific companies I’m applying to.

Provide exposure to a wider range of challenging problems to sharpen my problem-solving skills.

Give me the edge to confidently tackle technical rounds.

I plan to dedicate focused time to LeetCode over the coming weeks, and I’ll definitely update this post with my thoughts on whether it’s worth the investment.

If you’ve tried LeetCode Premium before, I’d love to hear about your experience in the comments! Let’s see if this purchase turns into a game-changer for my career goals.



<!-- ## MathJax

You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$


## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.
