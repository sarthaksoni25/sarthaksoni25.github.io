LTS is an abbreviation for “Long Term Support.” A new LTS version is released every two years and gets five years on five years of support and patches. The latest version of Ubuntu is 20.04 LTS, and codenamed as Focal Fossa. Ubuntu 20.04 released on April 23, 2020. This page shows you how to upgrade the existing version of Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. This blog is to help people with Nvidia drivers. I faced some issues while upgrading because of them.

1)Create a backup of your server or vm. 

<br/>
2)Upgrade all installed packages of Ubuntu version 18.04 by running sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade command.
{% highlight c %}

sudo apt update
sudo apt list --upgradable
sudo apt upgrade
{% endhighlight %}


<br/>
3)Run update manager with development release upgrade option

{% highlight c %}
update-manager -d
{% endhighlight %}

It may take a couple of minutes before informing you that a new version of Ubuntu is available.


<br/>
4)Start upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04 beta

The rest of the upgrade procedure is basically waiting for update downloads and clicking okay wherever requested.

## Nvidia Drivers Issue

After installing Ubuntu 20.04 when it booted this message popped up after the grub.

{% highlight c %}

dev/sda1: clean, 552599/6111232 files, 7119295/24414464 blocks

{% endhighlight %}


I have had this problem occur a few times, and every time it was ODDLY Nvidia's fault 

Go to recovery mode and purge Nvidia drivers you will be good to go:

sudo apt-get purge nvidia*


Enjoy all the new features in Ubuntu 20.04.

<!-- ## MathJax

You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$


## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.
